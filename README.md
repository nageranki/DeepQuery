DeepQuery is a rule-based Masters' SOP (Statement of Purpose) strength analyzer tool.

For comprehensive instructions on setting up and running this project, as well as detailed information about the dataset and other relevant details, please refer to the README_DeepQuery.txt file included in this repository.

README_DeepQuery is an extended, lengthier and our originally intented readme file written to avoid bombarding the user with info as soon as they open our repo :)
