DeepQuery is a rule-based Masters' SOP (Statement of Purpose) strength analyzer tool.

For comprehensive instructions on setting up and running this project, as well as detailed information about the dataset and other relevant details, please refer to the README_DeepQuery.txt file included in this repository.

For detailed analysis & documentation, refer to the 'Documentation & Analysis' PDF file.

Also, weâ€™ve included all our initial work, research & hit-and-miss attempts in the 'Hit & Miss (Various Initial Attempts)' folder. As in progress that we initially made and then scrapped in pursuit of better results.

Note: README_DeepQuery.txt is an extended and more detailed README file. We wrote it separately to provide in-depth information without overwhelming users with too much detail upon first accessing the repository.
